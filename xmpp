 implement a TCP-based text messaging app using a standard application-layer protocol, not a custom one.

Among standard protocols, the most suitable for messaging is:

✅ XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
Open standard (RFC 6120)

Uses XML over TCP

Designed specifically for instant messaging and presence

We’ll build a basic XMPP chat client and server using Python and the slixmpp library — a full XMPP implementation.

🧱 Architecture Summary
Layer	Protocol
Application	XMPP (XML-based protocol)
Transport	TCP
Network	IP
Link	Ethernet / Wi-Fi

🔧 Setup Requirements
Install slixmpp:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install slixmpp
You also need an XMPP server. You can:

Use a public XMPP server like jabber.at, xmpp.jp, dukgo.com, or

Host your own using Prosody or Openfire.

📲 Step 1: XMPP Client Code (Python using slixmpp)
This client logs in, sends a message, and prints incoming messages.

python
Copy
Edit
import slixmpp

class XMPPClient(slixmpp.ClientXMPP):
    def __init__(self, jid, password, recipient, message):
        super().__init__(jid, password)

        self.recipient = recipient
        self.msg = message

        self.add_event_handler("session_start", self.start)
        self.add_event_handler("message", self.message_received)

    async def start(self, event):
        self.send_presence()
        await self.get_roster()

        self.send_message(mto=self.recipient,
                          mbody=self.msg,
                          mtype='chat')
        print(f"Message sent to {self.recipient}")
        self.disconnect()

    def message_received(self, msg):
        print(f"Received message from {msg['from']}: {msg['body']}")

# Replace these with valid XMPP credentials
jid = "user1@jabber.at"
password = "your_password"
recipient = "user2@jabber.at"
message = "Hello from XMPP client!"

xmpp = XMPPClient(jid, password, recipient, message)
xmpp.connect()
xmpp.process()
🔁 Sample Message Exchanged
Over TCP, it would look like:

xml
Copy
Edit
<message to="user2@jabber.at" type="chat">
  <body>Hello from XMPP client!</body>
</message>
XMPP handles presence, delivery, and typing status as well.

✅ Benefits of Using XMPP:
Feature	Supported
Presence	✅
Message Queuing	✅
File Transfer	✅ (via XEPs)
Group Chat	✅ (via MUC)
Encryption	✅ (via TLS, OMEMO)
Standardized	✅

⚠️ Limitations
XML is verbose (larger than binary formats like WhatsApp uses).

May require manual configuration on self-hosted servers.

Not as lightweight as custom protocols.
